Projet 5
______________________

For the series of project 5 tasks, we should first develop an application with node-red capable of reading BLE data and displaying them through a node-red dasboard. To start, we download the node-red-contrib-epi-bluetooth module using the command "npm node-red-contri-epi-bluetooth " to get BLE notify and input nodes. Now we drag a BLE-notify node to create a device that will be visivle to the connecting clients. So we start by adding a new device definition by clicking on the pen next to device and we add the name "My bluetooth Device". Now we add a service name and add a universallly unique identifier that we chose from the website https://www.uuidgenerator.net/ . Last but not least, we enter a GATT characteristic UUID for a particular node and click done. We still need to drag a ble in node and select the defined Device and Service that we just configured but we only add unique Characteristic UUID . now by adding the connection shown in ble flow.jpg , we will be able to subscribe from ble-notify, because it will push a notification event to active listeners. ble-in will receive inputs from connected clients. It is Write-Only and accepts JSON strings as ble notify, and that's why timestamp(inject node) should be configured as json to be accepted. Numbre 7 will be shown on dashboard.

The second part of project 5 consists of building a tiny raspberry Pi3 image with buildroot. To do so, we start by downloafing buildroot using the command : " git clone git://git.buildroot.net/buildroot  ". Once we are done we cd to build root directory and type the command "make raspberrypi3_defconfig". if we want to get ssh and wifi working for example, we type the command "make menuconfig" which will open up a promt that allows us to configure, but in my case i'll not enter in details. Finally by typing the command" make -j8 " we will download the image in buildroot/output/images directory and this operation takes roughly 30 minutes . Now we can go to raspberry pi imager ,choose os then use custom, and use the image sdcard.img (159.4 mbs as shown in sdcard size.jpg) then choose the sd card and write. The boot up operation takes few secondes.
