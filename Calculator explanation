In order to create simple calculator in linux script, we will use nano editor (type nano in terminal) to write our code. The following synthax which acts like swicth case in language c
will help us simplify the task :
----------------------------
case word in
   pattern1)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern1 matches
      ;;
   pattern2)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern2 matches
      ;;
   pattern3)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern3 matches
      ;;
   *)
     Default condition to be executed
     ;;
esac

--------------------------
The command read , read from user input the number, and the command echo acts like "printf". Now if we want to save we use ctrl+o
and then enter. If we have an error we can edit our file using nano <filename> but we should be in the same directory. Once we are done
we save and we type in terminal sh <filename> to execute our file. Since bc doesn't interpret float numbers we use scale=2 to calculate
float numbers with 2 digits after floating point.
